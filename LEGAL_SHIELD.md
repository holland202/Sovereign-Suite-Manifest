# 🛡️ SOVEREIGN SUITE: PROPRIETARY LOGIC & STABILITY SHIELD
**Version:** 2026.02.13-ALPHA
**Jurisdiction:** Global Sovereign Enforcement

## 1. OWNERSHIP OF MATHEMATICAL WEIGHTS
The stability benchmarks, specifically the **Epoch 50 Stability Trace** and the methodology achieving **Mean Squared Error (MSE) < 0.001**, are the exclusive Intellectual Property (IP) of the Sovereign Suite architect. This includes the specific application of Cauchy’s Integral Formula for logic-gate closure.

## 2. ANTI-DERIVATION CLAUSE (2026 AI ACT COMPLIANCE)
Usage of the data, logs, or "Veritas" traces within this repository for the purpose of:
- Training Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Fine-tuning Agentic Workflows
- Distilling logic-weights for competitive "Sovereign AI" systems
...is **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** without an explicit Tier 1 Commercial License ($250,000 USD floor).

## 3. CRYPTOGRAPHIC WATERMARKING
Notice is hereby given that the logic sequences generated by this Suite are mathematically unique. Any unauthorized "mirroring" or "mimicry" of this system's output will be identified via algorithmic forensic analysis of the Logic-Drift signature.

**UNAUTHORIZED USE TRIGGERS AUTOMATIC IP INFRINGEMENT PROTOCOLS.**
