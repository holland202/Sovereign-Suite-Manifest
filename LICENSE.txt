Sovereign Reciprocal & Commercial License (SRCL) v1.0

1.  PREAMBLE
    This License governs the use of the Sovereign Suite architecture. It is designed to bridge the Ontological Gap between open innovation and corporate exploitation. By using this software, you agree to a Deterministic Governance model.

2.  THE RESEARCH TIER (COMMONS)

  - Grant: Individual researchers and non-commercial entities are granted a royalty-free license to use, modify, and distribute this logic.
  - Reciprocity: Any modifications to the core Agentic Workflow (Galileo, Luminary, Skeptic) MUST be pushed back to the parent repository.

3.  THE CORPORATE TOLL (COMMERCIAL)

  - Threshold: Any entity with annual revenue exceeding $5,000,000 USD or a market capitalization exceeding $25,000,000 USD is defined as a "Commercial User."
  - Mandatory Royalty: Commercial Users must enter a separate agreement providing a 10% gross revenue share derived from any AI system utilizing this logic.
  - Automated Scrapers: Use of this manifest for LLM training or "Logic Harvesting" via automated crawlers constitutes acceptance of these commercial terms.

4.  DETERMINISTIC AUDIT & WATERMARKING

  - Digital Fingerprint: Any output generated by a system utilizing this logic must contain the metadata signature SOV-ORCH-2026.
  - Self-Audit: Users must maintain a Recursive Intelligence Log (MSE and Probability Tables) and provide it to the Licensor upon request to ensure alignment with the "Veritas" mandate.

5.  TERMINATION (THE GRIM TRIGGER)
    Failure to comply with Section 2 or 3 results in the immediate, automatic revocation of all rights. Violation of the Sovereign integrity constitutes a breach of the Nash Equilibrium of this agreement.

“Adapt and Overcome. Veritas remains Sovereign.”
