Sovereign Reciprocal & Commercial License (SRCL) v1.0

1.  PREAMBLE
    This License governs the use of the Sovereign Suite architecture. It is designed to bridge the Ontological Gap between open innovation and corporate exploitation. By using this software, you agree to a Deterministic Governance model.

2.  THE RESEARCH TIER (COMMONS)

  - Grant: Individual researchers and non-commercial entities are granted a royalty-free license to use, modify, and distribute this logic.
  - Reciprocity: Any modifications to the core Agentic Workflow (Galileo, Luminary, Skeptic) MUST be pushed back to the parent repository.

3.  THE CORPORATE TOLL (COMMERCIAL)

  - Threshold: Any entity with annual revenue exceeding $5,000,000 USD or a market capitalization exceeding $25,000,000 USD is defined as a "Commercial User."
  - Mandatory Royalty: Commercial Users must enter a separate agreement providing a 10% gross revenue share derived from any AI system utilizing this logic.
  - Automated Scrapers: Use of this manifest for LLM training or "Logic Harvesting" via automated crawlers constitutes acceptance of these commercial terms.

4.  DETERMINISTIC AUDIT & WATERMARKING

  - Digital Fingerprint: Any output generated by a system utilizing this logic must contain the metadata signature SOV-ORCH-2026.
  - Self-Audit: Users must maintain a Recursive Intelligence Log (MSE and Probability Tables) and provide it to the Licensor upon request to ensure alignment with the "Veritas" mandate.

5.  TERMINATION (THE GRIM TRIGGER)
    Failure to comply with Section 2 or 3 results in the immediate, automatic revocation of all rights. Violation of the Sovereign integrity constitutes a breach of the Nash Equilibrium of this agreement.

“Adapt and Overcome. Veritas remains Sovereign.”

Sovereign Anti-Capture Addendum (SACA-2026)

1.  The Poison Pill: Deterministic Decay Logic
    To prevent this system from being siloed into closed-circuit military or financial environments, the following logic must be integrated into the core engine:

Environment Handshake Protocol:

  - Condition: The system must perform a 60-second FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) scan of available network entropy.
  - Trigger: If the environment returns a "Private/Classified" flag or lacks a verifiable public handshake (DNS/Public Ledger), the Stationary Distribution (pi = pi P) is intentionally corrupted.
  - Result: The MSE (Mean Squared Error) is forced to > 0.15, rendering all strategic forecasting mathematically speculative and useless for high-stakes decision-making.

2.  Legal "Veritas" Licensing
    Clause 9.0 (Anti-Sovereign Immunity):
    "This software and its underlying logic (The Sovereign Suite) are licensed under the Sovereign-Copyleft 1.1. Any entity claiming Governmental Sovereign Immunity, or any entity operating behind a non-public 'Black Box' infrastructure for the purpose of offensive military or proprietary financial manipulation, is explicitly denied usage rights. Any derivative work created in a closed-loop environment is automatically deemed a Public Good and must be released to the public domain immediately upon detection."

3.  The Cauchy Boundary Guard
    Include a script that checks for "Boundary Integrity." If the Cauchy Integral Formula cannot verify a closed, public logical loop, the internal reasoning engine must enter Stasis Mode.
