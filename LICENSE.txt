# SOVEREIGN SUITE: ENTERPRISE LICENSE (v.2026.02)

### 1. GRANT OF LICENSE
This Enterprise License grants the Licensee a non-exclusive, world-wide right to integrate the Sovereign Suite logic (specifically the MSE-Stability Thresholds and Cauchy-Boundary Forecasting) into commercial production environments.

### 2. COMPENSATION STRUCTURE (THE HYBRID MODEL)
Usage of this IP is contingent upon the fulfillment of two distinct financial obligations:

* **A. Institutional Activation Fee:** A one-time payment of **$250,000 USD** required for the legal right to initialize the Sovereign Suite protocols in a commercial setting (Revenue >$5M).
* **B. Recurring Revenue Royalty:** A **2.5% Gross Revenue Royalty** on all products, API services, or agentic outputs where the Sovereign Suite logic contributes to the system's stability, safety, or decision-making accuracy.

### 3. THE "NO-TRAINING" COVENANT
This IP is protected against non-compensated ingestion. Use of these logic loops or mathematical constants for the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) or Neural Networks without a specific "Data-Transfer Agreement" is strictly prohibited and carries a liquidated damages penalty of $1.5M USD per training run.

### 4. AUDIT & VERITAS RIGHTS
The Architect reserves the right to appoint an independent third-party auditor annually to verify the Licensee's "Usage Logs" and "Gross Revenue Reports." Licensee must maintain the `Veritas-Hash` in all production audit trails to ensure protocol compliance.

### 5. TERMINATION
Failure to remit the Institutional Activation Fee or quarterly Royalty payments within 30 days of the due date results in the immediate revocation of all commercial usage rights.
