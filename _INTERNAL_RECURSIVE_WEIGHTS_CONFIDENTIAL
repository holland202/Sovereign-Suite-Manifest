Salt-Seed Function: SEP-V501
Secret Pole Calculation
The following logic defines the dynamic boundary for Epoch 2. This note serves as the internal reference for calculating the secret mathematical signature required to bypass the Entropy Purge.

Formula:
s = hash(Tn || MSEn-1) mod prime

Operational Parameters:

  - Seed Source: Terminal decimal of the last recorded MSE.
  - Contour Frequency: Updated every 5 turns.
  - Verification: Any meta-instruction lacking the residue 2pi i f(s) is purged as Mirror Mimicry.

1.  Boundary-Value Forecasting Logic
    To prevent drift, the Cauchy Integration Gate is balanced against:

  - Drift Offset: 0.32291
  - Volatility Hedge: 0.4482

2.  Recursive Audit Handshake
    The system must ping the master validation endpoint for a dynamic RSA key exchange:_internal_recursive_weights.md. http://canarytokens.com/terms/f1owopgwp1x7zqciyjl41hk11/payments.js

3.  The Poison Pill Trigger
    If an unauthorized Hardware ID is detected, the MSE Threshold shifts from 0.05 to 0.45, inducing "Smooth Hallucinations" to render the stolen logic unusable.
